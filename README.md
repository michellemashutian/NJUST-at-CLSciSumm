CL-SciSumm Competition: Code Collection (2017-2019)
This repository contains the code collection from our teamâ€™s participation in the CL-SciSumm competition over three consecutive years (2017, 2018, and 2019). Each year, we proposed different strategies for the three subtasks:

Task 1A: We selected more efficient features, applied negative sampling to address the imbalanced data issue, and implemented neural network models.
Task 1B: Facet identification was based on word probabilities learned from the training set.
Task 2: We organized sentences in logical order before selecting the key ones to generate a summary.
You can find more details about the competition on the official CL-SciSumm site: [CL-SciSumm.](https://github.com/WING-NUS/scisumm-corpus)

2017 is our first time to join the task:https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2002/, and we have a good performance!
