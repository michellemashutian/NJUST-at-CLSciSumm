 The generation of possible output chunks is estimated through an inverted lexicon model and sequences of inserted strings (Tillmann and Ney, 2000). 	  ['Implication_Citation','Method_Citation'] 
 Some of these studies have concentrated on finite-state or extended finite-state machinery, such as (Vilar and others, 1999), others have chosen models closer to context-free grammars and context-free transduction, such as (Alshawi et al., 2000; Watanabe et al., 2000; Yamamoto and Matsumoto, 2000), and yet other studies cannot be comfortably assigned to either of these two frameworks, such as (Brown and others, 1990) and (Tillmann and Ney, 2000).

 Using parallel corpora (Kupiec, 1993; Feng et al., 2004), e.g., bilingual Wikipedia entries on the same person, renders high accuracy but suffers from high scarcity.To alleviate such scarcity, (Fung and Yee, 1998; Shao and Ng, 2004) explore a more vast resource of comparable corpora, which share no parallel document- or sentence-alignments as in parallel corpora but describe similar contents in two languages, e.g., news articles on the same event. 	  Implication_Citation 
 The traditional approch to translation extraction from comparable corpora and most of its extensions (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng, 2004; Otero, 2007; Yu and Tsujii, 2009; Marsi and Krahmer, 2010) presuppose the availability of a bilingual lexicon for translating source vectors into the target language.

 Additional German tags are obtained using the RFTagger 2 toolkit, which annotates text with fine-grained part-of-speech tags (Schmid and Laws, 2008) with a vocabulary of more than 700 tags containing rich morpho-syntactic information (gender, number, case, tense, etc.).

 For German, the POS and morphological tags were obtained from RFTagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008) which provides morphological information such as case, number and gender for nouns and tense for verbs. 	  Implication_Citation 
 While an improvement over simple destructive unification, Tomabechi&apos;s approach still suffers from what Kogure (Kogure, 1990) calls redundant copying. 	  Implication_Citation 
 This observation is the basis for a reordering method proposed by Kogure [1990]. 	  Implication_Citation

 We follow Pantel and Lin (2002) and Dorow and Widdows (2003) using the sentence as contexts and all words with a dependency path of length 3 or less, with the last word and its relation as a feature. 	  Implication_Citation 
 The parameters of the model can be estimated from tagged (1, 3, 4, 6, 12] or untagged [2, 9, 11] text. 	  Implication_Citation 
 In the same way, most NLP systems like information retrieval (Sekine, 2005) or question answering (Duclaye et al., 2003), based on pattern recognition, can be improved by a paraphrase generator. 	  ['Implication_Citation','Method_Citation'] 
 Indeed, the prominent approach for evaluating the quality of rule acquisition algorithms is by human judgment of the learned rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005). 	  Implication_Citation 
 We agree with Sekine (2005) who claims that several different methods are required to discover a wider variety of paraphrases. 	  Implication_Citation 
 The significance of inference rules has led to substantial effort into developing algorithms that automatically learn inference rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Schoenmackers et al., 2010), and generate knowledge resources for inference systems. 	  Implication_Citation 
 Some attempts were made to let annotators judge rule correctness directly, that is by asking them to judge the correctness of a given rule (Shinyama et al., 2002; Sekine, 2005). 	  Implication_Citation 
 As (Sproat ct a.l., 1996) testify, several native Chinese speakers do not always agree on one unique tokeniza.tion for a. given sentence. 	  Implication_Citation 
 First of all, it is really difficult to build a reliable and objective gold-standard given the fact that there is only 70% agreement between native speakers on this task (Sproat et al., 1996). 	  ['Implication_Citation','Results_Citation'] 
 In addition, there is no commonly accepted standard for evaluating the performance of word extraction methods, and it is very hard to decide whether a word is meaningful or not (Sproat et al. 1996). 	  Implication_Citation 
 As even human judges differ when facing the task of segmenting a text into words and test corpora differ from system to system (Sproat et al. 1996), it is very difficult to compare two methods. 	  Implication_Citation 
 Gold standards, however, 435 cannot be uniﬁed into a single standard (Fung and Wu 1994; Sproat et al. 1996). 	  Implication_Citation 
 The actual implementation of the weighted finiteÂ­ state transducer by Sproat et al.(1996) can be taken as an evidence that the hypothesis of one tokenization per source has already in practical use. 	  Implication_Citation 
 There are two approaches to solve this problem	  Implication_Citation 
 Purely statistical methods of word segmentation (e.g. de Marcken 1996, Sproat et al 1996, Tung and Lee 1994, Lin et al (1993), Chiang et al (1992), Lua, Huang et al, etc.) often fail to identify those words because of the sparse data problem, as the likelihood for those words to appear in the training texts is extremely low. 	  Implication_Citation 
 The principal work on segmentation has focused either on identifying words in phonetic streams (Saffran, et.al, 1996; Brent, 1996; de Marcken, 1996) or on tokenizing Asian and Indian languages that do not normally include word delimiters in their orthography (Sproat, et al, 1996; Ponte and Croft 1996; Shimohata, 1997; Teahan, et al., 2000; and many others). 	  Implication_Citation 
 There are many other OOV recognition methods proposed in literature before the rise of machine learning in the field.For example, the Sproat et al.(1996) system can successfully recognize OOVs of strong patterns, such as Chinese personal names, transliterations, using finite-state techniques. 	  Implication_Citation 
 In addition, Pedersen (2001) questions whether one statistic should be preferred over the other for the bigram acquisition task and cites Cressie and Read (1984), who argue that there are some cases where the Pearson statistic is more reliable than the log-likelihood statistic.

 (2004)) or Wikipedia (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006), and the contextual role played by an NP (see Bean and Riloff (2004)). 	  Implication_Citation 
 Methods for acquiring and using such knowledge are receiving increasing attention in 60 Proceedings of the Second Workshop on NLP Challenges in the Information Explosion Era (NLPIX 2010), pages 60â€“68, Beijing, August 2010 recent work on anaphora resolution.Dagan and Itai (1990), Bean and Riloff (2004), Yang and Su (2007), and Ponzetto and Strube (2006) all explored this task.

 Consequently, many strategies are proposed to balance the IV and OOV performance (Goh et al., 2005), (Zhang et al., 2006a). 	  Implication_Citation 
 Thus, the bigram â€œRAIL ENQUIRIESâ€ gives a misleading probability that â€œRAILâ€ is followed by â€œENQUIRIESâ€ irrespective of what precedes it.This problem happens not only with word-token corpora but also with corpora in which all the compounds are tagged as units since overlapping N- grams still appear, therefore corresponding solutions such as those of Zhang et al.(2006) were proposed.

 Assuming each bilingual sentence constitutes a mixture of hidden topics and each word pair follows a topic-specific bilingual translation model, Zhao and Xing (2006,2007) presented a bilingual topical admixture formalism to improve word alignment by capturing topic sharing at different levels of linguistic granularity. 	  Implication_Citation

 participants â€” causation, change of state, and others â€” are central not only in theoretical work on lexical semantics, but in computational approaches to the lexicon, as well (e.g.(Pustejovsky, 1991; Dorr, 1993; Wu and Palmer, 1994; Dang et al., 1998)). 	  Implication_Citation 
 We created a hierarchy of actions, exploiting the idea that verbs can be represented in a lattice that allows semantically similar verbs, such as motion verbs or verbs of contact, to be closely associatedwith each other under a common parent that cap tures the properties these verbs all share (Dang et al., 1998).

 Compare this to the "tune" set in van Halteren, Zavrel, and Daelemans (1998).This consisted of 114K.tokens, but, because of a 92.5% agreement over all four taggers, it yielded less than 9K tokens of useful training material to resolve disagreements.This was suspected to be the main reason for the relative lack of performance by the more sophisticated combiners.

 Many hand-tested corpus evaluations have been done in the past (e.g., Walker 1989; Strube 1998; Mitkov 1998; Strube and Hahn 1999), but these have the drawback of being carried out on small corpora. 	  ['Method_Citation','Implication_Citation'] 
 Since the so-called integrative approach to anaphor resolution was developed in the late 1980s (Carbonell and Brown 1988; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Asher and Wada 1989), and its practical viability extensively tested (e.g., Lappin and Leass 1994; Mitkov 1997, 1998), it has been common wisdom that factors determining the antecedentsof anaphors divide into filters and preferences. 	  Implication_Citation 
 Indeed, existing learning-based approaches to anaphor resolution have performed reasonably well using limited and shallow knowledge (e.g., Mitkov (1998), Soon et al. 	  Implication_Citation 
 Often domain-specific heuristics are used for anaphora resolution and fine tuned to perform well on a limited corpus, such as in (Mitkov, 1998). 	  Implication_Citation 
 Whereas knowledge-based systems like (Carbonell and Brown, 1988) and (Rich and LuperFoy, 1988) combining multiple resolution strategies are expenÂ­ sive in the cost of human effort at development time and limited ability to scale to new domains, more reÂ­ cent knowledge-poor approaches like (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996) and (Mitkov, 1998) address the problem without sophisticated linguistic knowledge.

 Computing logical forms (as, e.g., in Bos (2008)) and then deriving logically formulated rules from these rather than deriving sentential forms directly from text should also allow us to be more precise about dropping modifiers, reshaping into generic present tense from other tenses, and other issues that affect the quality of the statements.

 Since open-domain semantic parsers are able to produce formal semantic representations nowadays (Bos, 2008; Butler and Yoshimoto, 2012), it would be natural to see generation as a reversed process, and consider such semantic representations as input of a surface realization component.
