This is a file for the system we submitted in 2019 for CL-SciSumm.

Our team has attended the task in 2017 and 2018. In 2019, we propose new strategies for all the three subtasks for CL-SciSumm 2019. 
In task 1A, more efficient features are picked out, negative sampling is utilized to alleviate the imbalanced-data problem and neural network models are constructed additionally. 
For task 1B, we identify facet according to the probability of word learned from training set. 
In task 2, we firstly arrange sentences following logical order and then select important ones to generate summary.
